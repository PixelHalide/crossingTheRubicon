    <h1 style="color: darkred; text-align: center;">My First Website</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Hey, I just started learning HTML and wanted to post something cool I wrote. It's a story I found really interesting.</p>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">The River Was Red</h2>

    <p>Rome was tired.</p>

    <p>The streets still bustled, the temples still smoked with incense, and the senators still argued like kings, but the soul of the Republic was stretched thin. Greed had settled in its bones. Fear whispered through the marble corridors of the Senate. The people were restless. The old ways were crumbling, and everyone felt it, though few would say it out loud.</p>

    <p>Far to the north, a general stood on the edge of history.</p>

    <p>He had spent years winning Rome’s wars, painting the maps with victories, and building a legend out of blood and discipline. The men who followed him were loyal beyond reason. He had earned it. While the Senate dined, he bled. While they schemed, he built something unshakable. And now they wanted him to surrender it all. Lay down his command. Return alone.</p>

    <p>He saw through them.</p>

    <p>They didn’t fear his ambition. They feared that he was right. That he could lead better than they could pretend. That the Republic had become a mask, and behind it, power only served itself.</p>

    <p>And so, with his army at his back, he marched south.</p>

    <p>When they reached the Rubicon, the wind was sharp. The river looked small, almost pathetic, but the weight it carried was unbearable. No general was allowed to cross it with troops. That law had stood for generations. It was Rome’s final warning, a line carved into the earth not by swords, but by the idea of order itself.</p>

    <p>He stood at the edge and said nothing. The river didn’t speak either. It only moved, slow and cold, as if it knew what was coming.</p>

    <p>Then, without ceremony, he stepped across.</p>

    <p>The die was cast.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t a charge or a declaration. It was quiet. But in that silence, the world shifted. The moment his foot touched the far bank, the past was shattered. The Republic would not survive this.</p>

    <p>Back in Rome, panic spread. Senators packed their scrolls and fled. The city braced itself for war. The name of the man who crossed that river was no longer just a name. It was a prophecy.</p>

    <p>The battles that followed would scorch the earth from Spain to Greece. Cities would fall. Armies would be erased. Alliances would burn. And though the crown of Rome was never meant to rest on one head, history had already begun to shape one.</p>

    <p>The river had been crossed.</p>

    <p>The old world didn’t end in fire. It ended in footsteps.</p>
